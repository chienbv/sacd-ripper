TODO

  core:

    - test PS3 ripping pipeline
    - add dst decoding
    - write log along each consecutive rip
    - use output_format_t.error_number for error handling

  interface: 
  
    - ask which area to rip (in case of multiple)
    - show not enough disc space message (do fstat during ripping)
    - show correct progress information
        - title
        - current filename
        - progress total & MB/sec

  bug:
  
    - test the incorrect?? output length (audiogate tells me the tracks are a couple of frames bigger..)

  testing:
  
     - test multi channel exports
