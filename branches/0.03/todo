todo:

  core:

    - finish ripping pipeline
        - finish asynchronous processing loops and thread
    - add dst decoding
    - add sony dsf export support
    - write log along each consecutive rip
    - use output_format_t.error_number for error handling

    - ask which area to rip (in case of multiple)
    - show not enough disc space message (do fstat during ripping)
    - show correct progress information
        - title
        - current filename
